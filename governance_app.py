**General Roles (can vary by specific legislation & custom):**

* Promote social cohesion and harmony.
* Administer traditional justice (within legal framework).
* Assist with land administration matters (as per legislation).
* Liaise between community and government structures.
* Support implementation of specific government programs.

**Municipalities:**
* Responsible for local government administration.
* Primary responsibility for service delivery (water, sanitation, electricity, roads etc.).
* Develop and implement Integrated Development Plans (IDPs).
* Pass local by-laws.
* Manage municipal budgets and finances.
* Ensure democratic governance and public participation at local level.

**Key Area of Cooperation:** Integrated Development Planning (IDP), service delivery coordination, land use management, disaster management, local economic development.
"""

land_info = """
**Communal Land Information (General Overview):**

* Much rural land falls under communal tenure, often administered historically by traditional authorities.
* Post-1994 legislation aims to formalise rights and regulate administration. Acts like the TKLA and others outline roles for traditional councils in land matters, often requiring cooperation with government departments (like DALRRD).
* Rights of community members living on communal land are protected by law (e.g., Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act - IPILRA).
* Disputes regarding land allocation or rights within communal areas can be complex. Initial resolution may be sought via the Traditional Council, but formal legal avenues and government departments may be required.
* For specific advice or disputes, consult the relevant Traditional Council, the Dept. of Agriculture, Land Reform & Rural Development (DALRRD), or seek legal aid from organisations specialising in land rights.
